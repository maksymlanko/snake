d 100 -> show memory at 100
u 100 -> show instructions at 100

t -> single step 
r -> print regs


d fff0 -> see top of stack

BUG IN DEBUG.COM:
use ndisasm to check generated instructions, if you do u 100 on debug.com you might get wrong results !!!
example is sum.com when doing push strict word 5 instead of mov ax, 5 push ax
